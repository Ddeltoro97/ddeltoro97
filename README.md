# Fun fact about me
When I was no older than 14 I was a hardcore Pokemon fan, I wanted to create my own Pokemon videogame so I stumbled upon the ROM Hacking community. I started learning the basics but eventually ended up giving up that hobby. I do remember that some parts of the ROM hacking were similar to coding, so when I started diving into this world, I got this wholesome nostalgia feeling.
